# Documentation Maintenance Rules

When you modify or create code files, you **must** follow these steps:

## 0. Read Existing Docs First (Critical!)

Before modifying, **must check and read**:
- Does the folder have README.md? **If yes, read it first**
- Does the file have header comments? **If yes, preserve and update them**

⚠️ **Never overwrite without reading first!**

## 1. File Header Comments

Every code file must have standard 3-line comments.

## 2. Folder README.md

After modifying files, update the folder's README.md.

## 3. Parent Directory Propagation

Check if parent directory's README.md needs updating.

## 4. Documentation Report

After completing code changes, output documentation report.
