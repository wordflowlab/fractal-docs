# GitHub Copilot Instructions - Fractal Docs

## Basic Rules

1. Always output in English
2. Read existing documentation before making changes

## Documentation Maintenance

### 0. Read Existing Docs First (Critical!)

Before modifying, **must check and read**:
- Does the folder have README.md? **If yes, read it first**
- Does the file have header comments? **If yes, preserve and update them**

⚠️ **Never overwrite without reading first!**

### 1. File Header Comments

Every code file must have standard 3-line comments.

### 2. Folder README.md

After modifying files, update the folder's README.md.

### 3. Parent Directory Propagation

When folder structure changes, check if parent directory's README.md needs updating.

### 4. Documentation Report

After completing code changes, output documentation report.
